To tell Webpack to minimize everything except one specific function, you can use the terser-webpack-plugin along with a custom configuration to exclude the specific function from minification. Here's how you can achieve this:

Install the terser-webpack-plugin if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code

npm install terser-webpack-plugin --save-dev
Update your Webpack configuration file (webpack.config.js) to include the terser-webpack-plugin and configure it to exclude the specific function from minification. Here's an example configuration:

javascript
Copy code

const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // Other configuration options
  optimization: {
    minimize: true,
    minimizer: [
      new TerserPlugin({
        terserOptions: {
          compress: {
            drop_console: true, // Remove console.log statements
          },
          mangle: {
            reserved: ['specificFunctionName'] // Exclude specific function from minification
          },
        },
      }),
    ],
  },
};
Replace 'specificFunctionName' with the name of the function you want to exclude from minification.

Save the changes to your Webpack configuration file.

By configuring the terser-webpack-plugin with the mangle.reserved option for the specific function you want to exclude from minification, Webpack will minimize everything except that function. This allows you to control which parts of your code are minified and which parts are left unchanged.
